Hopefully this will be a useful resource for you all who want to keep learning Python and need a way to remind yourself of what you learned.",

Here are easy 4 steps on how to do so:\n\n1.\tRegister for a Boston Public Library eCard - <https://www.bpl.org/ecard/>. It’s free to anyone with an address in MA.\n2.\tSign up for an Overdrive account here –  <https://www.overdrive.com/media/1678411/scrum> OR download the Libby app on iOS /Android - <https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/libby-by-overdrive/id1076402606?mt=8>.\n3.\tLink your Libby/Overdrive account to your Boston Public Library eCard, and now you can borrow ebooks and audiobooks for free! As mentioned above, the Scrum book by Jeff Sutherland is available at BPL. The audiobook is narrated by JJ Sutherland and I quite like it.\n4.\tIf you want to view the book on your laptop, on the app Libby on your phone, go to the ebook you’ve borrowed on your shelf, and click “Send to Kindle”.

It seems like Virtual Box downloaded successfully and so did Ubuntu, but when I follow the instructions to set up a virtual box named \"Ubuntu\" and link it to the Ubuntu download, the installer never launches. If I click \"Start\" directly from the Virtual Box home menu, I get an error message that says \"Failed to open a session for the virtual machine Ubuntu\". I tried uninstalling and reinstalling and double checked the version compatibility, but this did not produce any results.\n\nFor now, I'm just using option 2 (running Ubuntu within windows 10), but it might be nice to figure out what went wrong. Thank you!",

If you are looking for a chief of staff role in the future, the economic prospects look like they can vary by quite a wide margin. 105 amounts paid were for $935 in the quarter. I would hope that these are biweekly paychecks, but this would seem to hover right around the poverty line. On the other hand, 66 people were paid $41,167 for the quarter which would lend itself to a nice salary. Also, if you are looking for a chief of staff position, it would appear that Nancy Pelosi would be the place to start -- she had twice the payments compared to the speaker of the house, Paul Ryan!

There are more than 44 million student borrowers.\nAccording to the above Harvard study, majority of college students - 42% of all 18- to 29- year olds have student loan debt and 70% of sampled students say that financial circumstances played an important role in college decision. The data also shows that community-college students were most impacted given that 87% of these students say it played an important role in their education decision compared to 70% college students. Student debt and college choice is also between White and Black Americans.  52% of 18- to 29- year old Blacks say it played a very important role compared to 38% of Whites.\nBelow table shows the historical trend in student loans in the U.S. For students receiving bachelor’s degrees, the average debt load at graduation was $30,000 in 2017. While the trend shows that the average student loan debt at graduation have slowed, but this may be due to shifting burdens from students to parents because more students are reaching federal student loan limits.",

        "text": "\"MAKING DEBT-FREE COLLEGE A REALITY\nDemocrats believe that in America, if you want a higher education, you should always be able to get one: money should never stand in the way. Cost should not be a barrier to getting a degree or credential, and debt should not hold you back after you graduate. Bold new investments by the federal government, coupled with states reinvesting in higher education and colleges holding the line on costs, will ensure that Americans of all backgrounds will be prepared for the jobs and economy of the future. Democrats are unified in their strong belief that every student should be able to go to college debt-free, and working families should not have to pay any tuition to go to public colleges and universities.\n\nWe will also make community college free, while ensuring the strength of our Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority-Serving Institutions. The federal government will push more colleges and universities to take quantifiable, affirmative steps in increasing the percentages of racial and ethnic minority, low-income, and first-generation students they enroll and graduate. Achieving these goals depends on state and federal investment in both students and their teachers. Whether full-time or adjunct, faculty must be supported to make transformative educational experiences possible.\n\nPROVIDING RELIEF FROM CRUSHING STUDENT DEBT\nAs we make college affordable for future students, we will not forget about the millions of borrowers with unsustainable levels of student debt, who need help right now. Democrats will allow those who currently have student debt to refinance their loans at the lowest rates possible. We will simplify and expand access to income-based repayment so that no student loan borrowers ever have to pay more than they can afford. And we will significantly cut interest rates for future undergraduates because we believe that making college more affordable is more important than the federal government making billions of dollars in profit off those loans. Democrats will also fight for a student borrower bill of rights to ensure borrowers get adequate information about options to avoid or get out of delinquency or default. We will hold lenders and loan servicers to high standards to help borrowers in default rehabilitate and repay their debts. We will continue the important Public Service Loan Forgiveness and loan discharge programs begun by the Obama Administration. Finally, Democrats will restore the prior standard in bankruptcy law to allow borrowers with student loans to be able to discharge their debts in bankruptcy as a measure of last resort. To make progress toward these goals, the government should offer a moratorium on student loan payments to all federal loan borrowers so they have the time and get the resources they need to consolidate their loans, enroll in income-based repayment programs, and take advantage of opportunities to reduce monthly payments and fees.\"",

User and Organization Pages that have this type of repository name are only published from the master branch.\"\n\nDo you think the problem might be that it's named \"sarah-hp.github...\" and you're publishing from other locations? I could use the options on the settings page to make a custom domain (e.g. <http://code4policy-a3.github.io|code4policy-a3.github.io> or something).

It has tons of characteristics of US colleges (size, type, student demographics, etc.). I think it might be interesting to look at whether the frequency of different types of schools (for- or non-profit) within states seems related to other characteristics of the state (that we could pull from census data, like poverty rate, etc.). For instance, are for-profit schools (that famously are exploitative of low-income students) more common in states with higher poverty rates?",

I hope you're having a nice weekend.\n\nI thought I would share the International Education Policy library page--they have links to a variety of data sets on education (UN data, PISA, World Bank... <https://guides.library.harvard.edu/c.php?g=309951&amp;p=2070359>. Perhaps we could consider finding our data set on one of those sites.\n\nOr, <@UF41X1ECV> if you want our project to focus more on bureaucratic/administrative aspects of education, we could maybe look into teacher absenteeism, the prevalence of public v. low-cost private schools in under-resourced settings, etc. Thoughts?\n\nWe could also consider comparing across different types of data (e.g. public opinion data as it compares to measured educational inputs/outputs..). I'm a big fan of Afrobarometer--they have continent-wide public opinion data on questions like whether girls and boys are perceived to have equal access to education (<http://afrobarometer.org/fr/analyse-de-donn%C3%A9es-en-ligne/l%27analyse-en-ligne#.XDIQhruMKeI.gmail>) (There's also Asiabarometer, etc.)\n\nI also saw a couple of interesting visualizations that might provide some inspiration as we think about our website:\n<http://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/>\n<https://ourworldindata.org/teachers-and-professors>",

We edited the file to include only columns: census tract number (column name in original: ct10_id, column name in final: ID) and percent unemployed (column name in original: unemp_p, column name in final: unemployed). We changed the CSV file to an excel file. Using the merged file containing Opportunity Zone census tract and town names, we used a VLOOKUP function to identify which census tract was an opportunity zone and filtered out non-opportunity zones, and merged in town name (column name in final: Town). We removed the first “25” from each census track.\n\nThe MA average unemployment (6.8%) was obtained from the United States Census Bureau’s FactFinder page (<https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml>). We searched for Massachusetts in the “Community Facts” search bar, clicked on “Income” on the left-hand navigation bar, clicked on “Employment Status (Age, Race, Sex, Poverty, Disability, Education, …)”, and clicked on “2016” in the Version menu. The 2016 version is the same time period as our 2012-2016 MAPC data.\n\nData cleaning: We removed census tract 25001014100 from Forestdale and 25025980101 from Winthrop due to poor quality or missing data.",

An Opportunity Zone is a designated geographic area, in which individuals can gain favorable tax treatment on their capital gains, by investing those funds (through a privately-created Opportunity Fund) into economic activities in the area. The U.S. Treasury has designated 138 tracts in 79 Massachusetts communities as Opportunity Zones. The Opportunity Zone program presents an opportunity for private, tax-advantaged investment into areas of economic need, benefiting both residents living in the zones and private investors. Governor Charlie Baker announced the designations on May 18, 2018.\n\nSome of the Massachusetts opportunity zones certified by the U.S. Department of the Treasury have left locals scratching their heads over why an incentive is needed to build. While low-income parts of Fall River, Springfield and New Bedford made the cut, so did neighborhoods in places like the tourist-heavy Provincetown as well as Alewife in West Cambridge, which developers are already building up as a life science relief valve to Kendall Square.",

This is still fairly recent so there's not a ton of data out there, but I have been able to find a dataset with all of the census tracts that were nominated and are eligible (<https://www.cdfifund.gov/Pages/Opportunity-Zones.aspx>).  I thought this could be represented as a map comparing the number / percentage in different states or could even be done at a city level (e.g., comparing the number between cities).  Am not yet super invested in this specific idea, so welcome any and all feedback!",

How about this: Let’s delete the file that is currently called “style.css” since nothing is linking to it, then rename “federal-main.css” to “style.css” and then we just need to change the reference on the html pages to that sheet. For the things that I’ve been adding to the federal-main page, I’ve been adding comments describing what is being styled so that we don’t confuse anything. With regard to the backend data, I’ll make a folder called “data” where we can store the original data, transformation code and readme file. Let’s each add our own information to the folder and readme based on what we’ve done",

Map - South Dakota - not clear take away.\n- generally: what are core take aways?

(Not be too function centric)\n- Think about the narrative - making it read like an essay is one example.\n- chart headers should be takeaways rather than questions\n- charts could be twice as big in terms of the size.\nOverall:\n- think about the connections between different pages. e.g. first page preface what we say.\n- blocks on the home page (hilary’s memo)\n- Another approach could be subject based — e.g. income equality &gt; then zoom in to regions?\n- professor will be evaluating on narrative coherence.\n- cite original visualization.",

Rather, you will find a dataset and place it in a folder within your repository.\n\nFor each dataset you should have:\n\na copy of the original data in the format you got it in\na README.md or README.txt file with a link to the original data source and an explanation about how you transformed the original data into the final format you needed. If you’ve done the transformation using a python script, just uplaod that script (no need to document). If you used some other means, please document your data transformation process in the README file. It should be a step by step explanation, not just one pithy sentence like “I transformed the data with excel”.\na copy of the final data which will be consumed by the visualization\nRemember, sometimes you might be able to tell a better story by filtering the data down to an interesting subset rather than visualizing all of it.\n\nNot sure if we need to do this before tomorrow for our MVP (in fact I doubt that we do), but we should do this before our final submission!",

        "text": "Hey <#CF6DAAQ2D|b1_econ_policy>, I have two ideas that I think might be worthwhile for my contribution to our project:\n\nMy *first idea* involves using real-time economic data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the U.S. Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve in order to provide visitors to our site with a real time update on the state of the U.S. economy as indicators are updated. In order to make it as seamless as possible, I would like to build an API to draw this data in as it's released from government agencies.\n\nExamples of where to find the data might be:\n<https://fred.stlouisfed.org/tags/series?t=nipa>,\n<https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/Pages/index.aspx>,\n<https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp/gross-domestic-product>,\n<https://www.bls.gov/bls/unemployment.htm>\n\nAnd the visualization could look similar to the FT's monitor on their website: <https://ig.ft.com/sites/numbers/economies/us>\n\nMy *second idea* is similar, but involves visualizing equities using real-time stock data from <http://yahoo.finance.com|yahoo.finance.com> to build a dataset of equities to model stock performance in real time.\n\nLet me know what you guys think and looking forward to chatting with you all tomorrow in class!\n\nJake",

I think in the private sector world, I could imagine this style being excruciating though. In the user story meetings, I would imagine companies would want the biggest possible problems solved in each meeting. Then if mismanaged, every daily scrum meeting would be a chance to show your inefficiency, and every retrospective/sprint review could be a deadline to work all night to finish deliverables for an artificial deadline. Just thinking about it, it seems like a dystopian nightmare that a capitalist would love.\n\nHowever, in government, this might be the best process. Government contractors surely can get overworked, but I would be surprised if any of them are working 100 hour weeks in usual circumstances. And government agencies that I've worked with are usually wow-ed by small incremental improvements. Suddenly the dystopia starts seeming more manageable and collaborative. I think this is where agile should live, and this is probably how you can start making bigger gains. That said, government agencies are notoriously slow to change, and agile seems will require just as many to changes to ageny perspective as it will for procurement processes. One can hope that more waterfall disasters and agile successes will slowly move the needle for more efficient and helpful governments.",

        "text": "I heard some feedback that agile &amp; SCRUM seemed like a lot of overhead work for this class--but I think that actually highlights exactly what SCRUM is supposed to provide. SCRUM commits us upfront to a significant investment in communication and management that yield savings over the life of the project. It's not a great fit for a short, 2-week project that is unlikely to face major scope and schedule drift, precisely because the project is too short and low-risk to yield much savings in schedule slippage.\n\nBasically--yes, it's a lot of meetings and can feel like a lot of overhead. But that's nothing compared to public-sector norms of quarterly meetings where nobody does anything substantive for 2.5 months and then scrambles some half-assed work together in the last couple weeks before the meeting. Daily meetings take a lot more \"overhead\" time than quarterly, but that investment is well worth keeping constant tabs on schedule and scope (and, frankly, helping prevent those occasional weeks in the nonprofit/public world when you just zone out and don't get much done and nobody really notices, because there's no regular followup).\n\nFurthermore, without daily meetings I don't think the agile process would work at all. Without that constant daily communication, we wouldn't be able to make tasks independent and doable in parallel. For quarterly or even monthly meeting approaches, we would very likely need to fall back on waterfall methods to make sure each team doesn't pursue long dead-ends of incompatible workflows in between the monthly followups. These are the management takeaways that I think can scale into physical businesses (like transit authorities), beyond software development.",

On the one hand, I do believe in the *idea* of a semantic (openly-connected) web in the same way I believe in dismantling trade barriers and tariffs in the international economy: It is a nice theory but not practical in the real-world.\n\nOn the other hand, I do not want a completely fee-for-service web where each site hoards its data, requires subscriptions for access and tolls for traveling by…\n\nInstead, I believe these two extremes represent the nodes on a continuum of which the openness of the web is a point on the distribution. And that point on the distribution is not static, but rather is constantly changing depending on laws, regulations and the political climate!\n\nFor instance, under the Trump Administration and Chairman Pai of the FCC, we have moved away from Net Neutrality and may be moving increasingly towards the anti-Aaron Schwartz position.\n\nAny thoughts from anyone on my supposition on a *dynamic political culture of the internet* and *where we are now on the continuum*?

High level of iteration allows enough failure early enough in order to identify problems. This allows one to solve the projects.

The daily meetings I believe also encourage the team to get more work done as one has to show it in class.

In one of our projects, we had too many people involved with no clear, quick way to keep track of the deliverables. One of the consultants introduced SCRUM to the leadership team, including only the top 7 people leading each team to provide very quick headlines on their progress and the roadblocks.\n\nUltimately, SCRUM didn't hold up to our expectations. As <@UF19DNZ5E> mentioned, it is difficult to implement SCRUM on monumental size projects. In total, we had over 150 people working on the project, and to narrow it down to just 7 people for frequent, daily meetings meant that these 7 people spent their entire days obtaining updates from their staff, however small. They did not trust leaders from other teams, hence the stand-up meetings simply became somewhat of a pissing contest. Saying nothing would have been terribly embarrassing and nobody wants to talk about their roadblocks. This was in Southeast Asia, where \"saving one's face\" is commonly important.\n\nAs mentioned by my other classmates, I wonder if SCRUM has a place in large scale projects, and in areas where cultures where trust is not the norm. I'm only halfway through the book and am still reading up more material, so I hope I will be convinced otherwise by the end of this class!",

First off, these readings have continually reinforced how my first job at IBM in IT project management was largely learning an obsolete craft. For two years, we were ingrained to employ the waterfall method and consistently valued documentation and project tracking over actually getting the software done right by creating user value. We slowly started to do some things to shift towards agile lite like deploying automated testing and breaking the massive phased projects into smaller chunks that were somewhat \"Sprint\" like. Still, a valuable experience to learn the pitfalls of a failed approach (which were demonstrated by our constant project delays and client tension. Second, the readings made me think about my own effort this summer in Chicago to promote a \"US Digital Service Model\" for Chicago's City Government. Serving as an intern in the Mayor's Office, we were each tasked with proposing a New Idea as part of annual competition. I had read about the US Digital Service Model and a similar version at the city level in Austin, TX and decided to proposed replicating it Chicago. It was interesting how the turf war nature of Chicago's city government immediately disliked the idea of IT folks coming in and messing with traditional lines of authority. By the end of the summer, I was able to make some progress in encouraging the idea, but it demonstrated the difficulty in pitching \"good ideas\" with proven results, especially when they cause disruption in the status quo.",

        "text": "I wonder how much Agile and Scrum have been explored in other sectors and what the results have been. A good example is that of R&amp;D grants. Granting agencies like NSF or DoE traditionally grant resources to R&amp;D projects based on a waterfall approach. The R&amp;D process is one of information discovery, meaning that at the onset of a project, the outcomes could be predicted but not guaranteed. On top of that, an R&amp;D project can reveal new information that is not known before the grant was awarded but that merits pursuing new and different activities. Researchers and granting agencies could benefit highly from adopting an agile framework in which grants are approved based on scientific merit of a team and the general ideas they want to pursue. Progress can be reviewed in sprints and rather than having a complete project described at the onset, the activities could flow with the newly acquired information to areas that show higher promise for breakthrough or innovation.",

At the risk of sounding too idealistic/naïve (which Sam appropriately addresses above), I was pretty excited to think about this team of coders tackling such a massive and important system and ultimately being able to cut the cost of building the system by $256 million and the cost of annual maintenance by $69 million. I wish I could understand coding better just so I can get a more technical understanding of their approach. How did this team know where to even begin when they opened the login page and identified glitches?\nThe part about the team having to wait to get a security review on AWS really resonated with me as someone who worked in federal contracting before coming to HKS. Deadlines often get pushed further and further into the future for project components that in theory shouldn’t be a source of stress, which can be frustrating. This relates to a topic that I would love to have the speakers’ take on: there seems to be so many “blockers” to implementing significant change in government systems- from budgeting to deep-seated silos to outdated procurement to overall skepticism. What would the speakers say are major barriers to applying scrum in the public sector that one wouldn’t typically see in the private sector, and how do they envision overcoming them using Scrum techniques? In the second Scrum reading, one of the barriers, skepticism, was raised, but the solution was glossed over. I imagine this is a major issue in the public sector, but also an inconsistent one. I wonder if the speakers have any experience/successes with overcoming it that they could share.",

It seems like a way of allocating time and effort that is so intuitive, I might apply it to my own to do lists.\n- In reading the <http://healthcare.gov|healthcare.gov> articles, one mentioned the failure of opening the website to everyone at once instead of starting with a small circle to get feedback, iterate, and expand to more people over time. While starting small and iterating seems to be the way to get a good working product, in the context of a government service, how do you decide who gets first access in an equitable manner? Is it unfair to offer it to some, but not others? Alternatively, this may be irrelevant if we set up the roll out to be transparent about who will get access and when.",

        "text": "Many policymakers are painfully unaware of how data can be used to advance their policy goals in a more targeted way to better serve constituents. Even slow and cumbersome systems like at the FBI can prevent organizational missions from being completed successfully. In my personal experience, government technology systems lag behind those of private firms, and for some obvious reasons (like funding). But if improving technology improves the functionality of government, then technology enhancements should be a top priority for governments.\n\nA question to our guest speakers: what are the main barriers to productivity or effectiveness in your experience in government? What are some specific ways we can apply the agile/scrum mindset to overcome obstacles to flow in our teams? And, given that not everyone on a team will have experience working in scrum, what methods should we use to change the mindset of our teams? I don’t want to rely too much on training, but at the same time, these processes only work if everyone buys in. So, especially if we are not the team manager, how do we promote buy in and collaboration around this approach?\n\nIt also seems like there are tradeoffs between getting work done as quickly as possible and doing it right, even if it takes slightly longer. It makes sense that most teams have areas where efficiency can be improved, but in some cases the teams are working as fast as can be reasonably expected. As a manager, what tools can be used to identify the point at which efficiencies are being maximized, without crossing over into the space where errors are being made?",

        "text": "Scrum/Agile is definitely a thought provoking approach to team management.  I worry a bit that there may be a false dichotomy between a more agile approach and a waterfall method.  Here are a few of the concerns I came up with:\n-Scalability.  Its not clear to me how scrums would work on monumental size projects.  Communication between hierarchical or peer scrums is not facilitated.  This could result in teams independently \"re-inventing the wheel\" to solve the same or similar problems.  Additionally, Scrum's heavy reliance on trust would make it very hard to incorporate into big organizations.  Similarly, self organizing teams seems unlikely in some of these institutions.\n-Story choice aggregation.  The increasingly short nature of sprints makes the focus more and more on small user choices.  For instance, Facebook programmers might be looking at a user story in which the user desires some convenience at a small cost of privacy.  This story may be perfectly fine in the individual case, but as the same choice is repeated you can end up in a place you never expected.\n-Similarly, some choices and priorities are inherently more likely to \"win\" out over time.  For instance, a story about user convenience is likely relatively straightforward and easily quantifiable (some period of time saved).  A story about privacy is likely to be much more convoluted and more difficult to break into bite sized pieces.  Thus by the Scrum methodology, the convenience story is likely to continuously rise to the top of the list while privacy remains at the bottom as a bigger, more nebulous story.  This is true of other concepts such as autonomy (freedom) vs safety or security.\n-Organized labor.  I've been trying to conceptualize what a Scrum environment would look like in an industry with strong unions.  Haven't come up with anything yet.\n\nThis isn't intended to be overly negative towards the Agile process, it has many advantages.  Is there a way to combine the advantages of a Scrum-like approach with those from Waterfall planning?",

That isn’t to say that the folks who got <http://healthcare.gov|healthcare.gov> working weren’t very smart or talented, but it seems like the agile ideal would be to have them integrated more smoothly into the government’s infrastructure, able to collaborate with non-coder colleagues on a day-to-day basis. Granted, a lot of the mystique here might be media-created and not reflective of the on-the-ground experience of government employees who worked with the coders, but it still seems like scrum has a bit of an image problem. I wonder what teams using scrum methods can do to overcome programming's mystique and appear more approachable for non-coder stakeholders, since it won’t do much good for coders to want to collaborate if the non-coders are hesitant to do so.",

Again, I am curious about government projects that require extra caution and face critical scrutiny (and where people love \"control and predictability\" and less tolerant about failures). 3) Scrum members have total authority over how the work gets done and seem to have lots of discretion. How does the team ensure continuity if  a team member left unexpectedly, given that there is no detailed documentation?",

The advantage of the assembly line is efficiency. It is obvious that the scrum team is not assembly line but with the high efficiency. How does it work, is that also means the way of assembly line is out of date?\n\nQ2: Since the scrum is an open system, how to guarantee the information security between a lot of different cooperation especially in government project need to be confidential.",

I have one question about agile as it pertains to government organizations--do you think an agile approach could potentially allow for security risks by bringing in a wider array of participants? 18f would seem to open the door for a lot of people (perhaps with no security clearance) to be highly involved in producing government platforms, etc.\n\nTo be a bit more specific -- The Wired piece (on the Obama tech surge) seems to mock fears of a flexible, parachute-in approach to fixing problems. Do you think these concerns are valid at all?\n\nExcerpt:\n\"Judging from the focus of a recent hearingheld by the House Oversight and Government Reform IT Subcommittee, one might think that the most pressing issue in government tech was not saving money and delivering services effectively, but making sure that the Chief Information Officer (CIO) in a given agency has total reign over his or her domain (Congress had recently passed a law granting agency CIOs more authority). Will Hurd, the subcommittee chair, frettedd that USDS people might “parachute into an agency, and fix things, without the knowledge of the CIO.”\n“But the calls for “accountability” from this nascent effort seem out of proportion to the tiny investment that the USDS represents. In fact, these demands seem very much a part of the risk-averse culture that led us to the current mess in government IT.”",

        "text": "I'm still reflecting on the Scrum readings, but a few initial thoughts and questions:\n-One aspect I feel like most of the readings glossed over was how the \"gathering requirements\" step is much faster or more efficient using Agile methodologies or Scrums.  Wouldn't you still need to do the legwork of understanding basic requirements and creating User Stories?  How long does this take?  What makes it fundamentally faster than the same step in the Waterfall?  My understanding is that it leads to efficiencies down the line as you only prioritize what is truly needed, but in order to do that, don't you still need to build this basic foundation of requirements?\n-I'm curious about how the contract negotiation and expectation setting works using this model.  I thought the readings made great points about the added bureaucracy, difficulty in sticking to predetermined milestones, and frequent cost overruns using the Waterfall method.  But it also highlighted the skepticism that stakeholders may have towards the limited information an agile team would be able to provide at the offset of a project.  It looks like most agile teams are able to build trust with stakeholders over time through constant interaction and early delivery of working products, but how do they get over the first hurdle?  How have these teams been able to avoid the pitfalls of the Waterfall approach and structure more efficient contracts while also managing  their stakeholders' expectations?\n-Echoing some of the sentiments brought up in class, even after the readings I have a keen sense that using Scrum teams must be predicated on having a really strong and motivated team.  Based on my own experience working across a couple of different sectors, I really have a hard time visualizing this working in many non-tech environments.  I would be really curious to hear successful cases of where this has worked beyond technology development\n-As a bit of an aside, I was a bit surprised by the harsh treatment \"Scrum: The Art of Doing Work in Half the Time\" gave to Gantt Charts.  While it's likely not the best way to plan projects, I've seen them used very successfully in general project planning (though I may be biased given my background--in my former life as a consultant and when working with non-profits, setting clear project plans, deadlines, and expectations were essential).  This relates to my previous point in that I'm still a bit skeptical of how well this approach works in other contexts",

In this way, it shows more information to better understanding the future trend of AV development as well as its inner relationship with human-drive cars.",

Sorry it's a lot, but we didn't feel like we could make the content-specific changes to your page. Please let me know when you're done!\n\n<@UF3CMBX46> once Ruha updates Trello, I'll submit our burn rate and post the \"artifacts\" defined in the project requirements.\n\n@EVERYONE: stay up-to-date on pushes/pulls if you are making changes. Text if you're confused or if you need someone to look at your GitHub pull request.\n\n@EVERYONE: approve open pull requests on GitHub as able.\n\n<@UF3CMBX46> I will submit the final version *tomorrow* once I hear the above tasks are 100% done.\n\n@EVERYONE: we need to submit the Retrospective meeting when the site is totally done. I can take the lead on this, but we'll need to talk about our answers.\n\n@EVERYONE: Individually, we must each also submit an Agile reflection (see hw for more info)\n\nWe're in the home stretch!

        "text": "Hi Tabinda,\nHere are the paragraphs. I imagine that we can hyperlink with html and so each of these links can be embedded in parts of the text:\n\nClimate change can increase wildfire risk in California through its effects on moisture availability, temperature, vector prevalence, and lightning. Several academic papers have linked climate effects by showing that climate change has increased drought in California (<https://www.pnas.org/content/112/13/3931.long>), led to more pine beetle infestations and tree mortality (<http://science.sciencemag.org.ezproxy.library.tufts.edu/content/362/6416/758.1>), and augmented the flammability of vegetation that fuels wildfires (<http://tenaya.ucsd.edu/tioga/pdffiles/Westerling_wildfire_jan2008.pdf>). As a result, modelling efforts predict that wildfires will become more frequent and larger throughout the century (<http://tenaya.ucsd.edu/tioga/pdffiles/Westerling_wildfire_jan2008.pdf>).\n\nIn addition, separate research has shown lightning strikes in the western United States are will become more frequent in an altered climate, which bodes poorly for California where wildfires are most often ignited by storms (<http://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/vollaro/pubs/Romps.et.al-SCI2014.pdf>). With higher temperatures, fires are expected to rage hotter and lay scourge to more area (<https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2014/10/13/what-do-wildfires-have-to-do-with-climate-change/>). For these reasons, normally-cautious scientists have begun to draw a causal link between climate change and forest fire (<https://www.pnas.org/content/113/42/11649>). With large fires in the state over the past few years, the media has joined the frenzy, proclaiming that California is burning and climate change is the cause (<https://www.usatoday.com/pages/interactives/news/california-wildfires-carr-fire-data/>)\n\nAbove, we showed that California has gotten dryer and hotter especially in the areas of the Mountains where many of the state’s forests lie. Below we have taken a separate data source to show how those changes have corresponded to fire trends.",

Before then we will all review the California relevant resources in this thread and look for additional climate data for California. Ashlyn said she would look for some `budget data` so we can start thinking about the cost of climate change and I will consolidate some of the `academic context` from articles to provide a backdrop for our narrative. Please add or correct to these targets (this is just what I understood)\nThanks!",

I thought it would be interesting to visualize Brazil’s climate goals (from their INDC) and show how Bolsonaro’s policies compare. We could break this down by sector and potentially showing how this could affect Amazon forest cover by using Google Earth Engine (which uses Javascript to work with satellite imagery).\n\nSince talking to the team, it seems like it may be better to do something more centered on climate change impacts on the city. We could take a few different case studies (based on what data is available) and try to visualize current and future impacts of climate change. If possible, I would like to try my hand at Google Earth Engine through this project (one of my learning goals), but I think this software could have various applications to a potential project including showing drought, forest cover, and other landscape-level changes.\n\n*Here is what I wrote out about the first idea that I think we will not use*:\n* Show how Bolsonaro’s policies could impact the Amazon rainforest\n* How that could relate to climate change\n* How that could relate to Brazil’s NDC and climate goals (I wrote a memo on Brazil’s NDC and climate goals before Bolsonaro was elected)\n\nThings we need:\n* Understanding of previous policy (have this)\n* Understanding of his policy (don’t have this)\n* Find datasets (don’t have this)\n* Start visualizing different sectors and change (don’t have this)",

But checking the gitrepo page, there are errors that don't make sense, don't show in command line, or are because of https, which I'm not sure what we could do.  Below, I am including some pictures from the git.repo link vs. the command line local server running the same information from master.  Please let us know how you think it is best to proceed.  I'm happy to hop on with you later if you believe these errors are still within our purview to fix and if it's not an inconvenience. Many thanks, Maria",

He said his server was cached so it kept loading the same site without the problems we were seeing.  However, we're not sure that's actually the problem.  Although we all had different versions showing on local.server (pics/no pics) we worked to fix the links and files communicating on the page.  When <@UF4GQD2BC> (mac user) now runs the website (what we think is our final) from command line on the server he sees it, however, I still can't .  We've both cleaned our cache history.  Possibly in your browser, you will be able to tell us if the product is as we think it is.  If given this info, you'd still like us to submit what we have we will do so asap tomorrow morning.  We are very sorry about the delay and did not anticipate being so behind.  Thank you.",

However, we wanted to flag something for your attention before creating the issue request on github.  The last 24-36 hours the windows vs. macs in our group have been able to see local host very differently in server tests.  The windows users have not been able to see any pictures and not all charts.  The mac users have been able to see everything well displayed.  We all made our final changes to master and created the github page link from my account (mariagbl- windows user), in our github pages link, the same troubled windows layout is showing up, despite mac tested confirmations of the master running well on local host.  Here is our repository link: <https://github.com/mariagbl/Team-Project-B2>  and git pages link: <https://mariagbl.github.io/Team-Project-B2/>.  We have also created an issue in git hub, we haven't marked it \"Ready for Review\" yet, but instead included this message, just asking for your advice on how best to submit our project when we're not sure how to resolve the difference between the master and published page.  Many thanks, Team B2",

To analyze the relative frequency of Trump’s comments on migration we visualize the total amount of tweets by @realDonaldTrump compared to the percentage of those tweets dedicated discuss migration.\n\nAs shown in the graph, Trump is not currently tweeting at his highest leve, however, in January 2019  about 33% of his tweets were related to migration issues. This means that for every 10 tweets coming from Trump’s account, at least three of them are related to migration.",

When we wrote you earlier in the evening we were in a bit of a crisis, where our almost finalized webpage and back-end all shifted, changed and parts disappeared.  We've been working since then to try and re-create the final product to where it was, but remain unable to confirm three of our d3 image links, and two back-end data files.  The data files are still  reading in the final product but have shifted somewhere and we are trying to locate them.   We sincerely apologize for not being able to submit on time and not asking for an extension sooner.  We were hopeful that we would be able to fix everything to still turn it in tonight.  We will aim to turn in the project as soon as we can get it finalized tomorrow.  Please let us know if you have any questions.  All the best, Team B 2",

I found an (open-source/ github) app, that analyzes and visualizes hate speech from twitter accounts in Spanish in real time. If we decide to go this direction, we have some open-source coding that we can borrow an adapt to our own needs.  <https://odiometro.es>",

Nonetheless, as far as I know, this is a work that it is still being performed by humans, as the analysis of syntaxis is a very sophisticated operation. We could,  however, use the analysis that has been already done on speeches of famous leaders available in the database repository of Team Populism: <http://populism.byu.edu/Pages/Datat>\nOur project could consist only on visualizing what is already there, to make people aware of the level of populism of their president/ prime minister",

In a time where the likes of Squarespace or other website building providers exist, it can seem like a disconnect to most people why the guidance on designing URLs matters.   I myself, formerly having been one of those users!  Having now been on the development side of our agile sprint process, I can appreciate the importance of Swartz's guidance for the short term--(our sprint goal of having a working product website) and more broadly to the long term reach of an API.  As a newbie to thinking about how to structure something that will eventually be used by thousands, if not more people, and be plugged into other platforms or websites, the seemingly simple task of thinking of a URL structure seems much more complex and critical.  Swartz's emphasis on these types of fundamentals overlap with with Musser's (  <https://www.infoq.com/presentations/API-design-mistakes>) tips to API developers on how to make API's more user friendly.  Until hearing his presentation, I hadn't categorized API's as a user focused product.  I was more focused on the exciting potential they provided in being able to harness open source data towards set user/ product/or value goals.  However, it makes sense, within software and technology innovation, that a fundamental tool of how tech is better able to serve users (APIs) is also itself a user-focused product.  The focus on users (mostly, as it seems, developers) will lead to the further integration and usability of APIs as foundational components of more software innovation.  Extending agile principals to API's users enables the success of their hopes to build technology that focuses on users as well.",

As I understand now, the web 2.0 is focused on the interactions and feedback from other users. Websites are developed and to a certain degree depend on the grading, commenting, editing, sharing and rearranging that users do while they visit the site. Web 3.0 is based on the capacity of machine systems to extract and use information taken from other websites, mainly meta data. In this order of ideas, it is interesting to conceive the abstraction level in which the internet currently operates.",

Then it was NYC DOT's Vision Zero portal, which hosted open data on street treatments and traffic fatalities that allowed me to assess the impact of street safety treatments on timeseries data of traffic deaths. In a pre-Aaron Schwartz world, none of that would have been possible (even if he probably would have thought Tableau's products are shittier than the non-proprietary alternatives).\n\nI agree with the earlier comments that the privacy implications of a lot of social network APIs still have to be worked out--for example Venmo's API can be queried for the social web of any public payments. I've heard that researchers have been able to heuristically identify user types and scenarios--e.g. drug dealers, sex workers, and \"a breakup\"--through ML and clustering.

This is part of a much broader debate about rules and regulations relating to campaigns, but I have to imagine part of the challenge for policymakers is such as complete lack of understanding of this ecosystem and how this all functions. It creates a situation where it is the wild west with politicians creating crap regulations that don't actually address the issue. It seems like there is just two completely distinct mindsets.

I see some instances where this would be great--accessible APIs are popular with programmers for a reason, they democratize access to different data sets and make it easier to leverage existing products or commonly used functionality (in the case of Google or banking products, for example).  However, in light of our security conversation, I can't help but feel like too much access could be a dangerous thing.  Certainly allowing anybody to edit or access code for an essential website could be dangerous, but I'm curious about the security risks APIs might pose.  Were, for example, the pretty notable revelations that Facebook data was captured and shared by different applications a result of an easy to use and accessible API?",

However, I think it is not uncommon for technologists and coders to be naive at the implications of \"democratizing\" various aspects of society.

For every success (wikipedia) there seem to be countless instances of \"fake news\" or other bad actors taking advantage of a democratized environment.  A credentialized marketplace had two advantages we would be well served to incorporate into open-source, if possible:  1) Expertise.  In order to publish something or to get it in front of people at a mass scale, an author or publisher had to be a peer reviewed expert.  These gatekeepers slow down processes and sometimes don't have incentives that are perfectly aligned with the general public, but they also provide a vital measure of quality control and sorting that the general public is incapable of.  2) Accountability.  If a product does damage, or is false or nefarious, credentialing provides both the culprit and repercussions (removal of credentials).  This is vital to keep open source arenas clear of bad actors.",

I benefitted from d3 examples that were provided to build our final projects around them.

Opening up data through software could be useful in the circumstances where data is already meant to be public and the software serves as a good tool to transfer such information.

Schwartz cites Richard Stillman from MIT who had 4 basic freedoms associated with open source as a definition -- freedom to use for any purpose, see the source code, share with anyone, and release improvements. I wonder if open sourcing needs a 5th element regarding interpretability. It seems that this definition was made by a computer scientist for computer scientists, but as software starts running more of the average person's life, I think that we need to start aiming for software to be open to the average person as well.

On one hand, by opening up code and data to all users, we have the ability to expand infinitely beyond our current knowledge base to build new platforms and services. It also allows us to crowdsource help with solving complex problems. At the same time, Dhrumil mentioned a really interesting case where a team’s code/data could be their main competitive advantage, and allowing open access to it on the web could inhibit their success. This brings up the issue of when it is alright to take the data from someone else’s website (with proper citation, of course) and when it is not. I’m not sure that we can trust all individuals to think through this distinction before acting. However, I also do not know how we can address this problem without limiting access to data for everyone. If anyone has any policy solutions to this, I would love to discuss.\n\nFrom my own background, I know that economists at think tanks around DC have been working hard to make their data open source for exactly the same reasons as coders. One example is AEI’s open source policy center: <http://www.aei.org/feature/open-source-policy-center/>, which allows users to estimate the impacts of public policies. Their “tax brain” site also contains a GitHub account where users can make changes to AEI’s tax model for their own research. I think initiatives like this are one way to make public policy more interactive for the general public by allowing citizens to engage with the data, rather than assuming policy comes from a black box somewhere in DC. Open source policy work also allows the policymaking process to be more iterative, allowing citizens to design policy solutions to the problems they face from the bottom up, rather than waiting on lawmakers to enact change from the top down.",

And do you understand what makes it so much harder to create a peer-to-peer app as compared to a web app? I can imagine that having user-customized apps communicate together without an online medium could throw unexpected errors or that the increased distribution of traffic could add complexity to existing networks, but I am not sure exactly what makes this model so much harder to create (besides political inertia and user competency of course).\n\nI also found the point about having the freedom to download both the code and data from websites to be thought-provoking. I agree that we should be able to see and download our own data on websites (like Facebook), but I am having a hard time picturing what downloading other data you have access to would entail or how that could cause problems. He suggests that you should be able download all of your friends data on Facebook too (presumably stuff on their wall and visible things). That alone does not worry me, but I would think that such a change would also need to be communicated clearly to people so that they can adjust their behavior accordingly and I wonder where this philosophy of open code and open data would lead to a compromise of privacy even after people have an expectation that anything they post is truly public. For instance, having this distributed access would likely make it harder for propositions like the Right to be Forgotten laws in the EU to exist: <https://gdpr-info.eu/issues/right-to-be-forgotten/>.\n\nAnyway, I am curious to hear other people’s thoughts on Schwartz’s vision for the internet in terms of its feasibility, tradeoffs, and to what extent his suggestions have come to pass.",
