The first gives tips to civil servants for bringing colleagues in a government project on board with the \"agile\" concept. One tip that I liked was focus on the ideas of the agile manifesto rather than the term itself, and to perhaps use different terminology such as \"pilot program\" or \"incremental development\" to pitch it to potential skeptics. The second  post describes an \"Agile Contract Format\" that 18F developed as a substitute for often onerous government acquisition contracts. Both of these posts make mention of the \"agilefall,\" a term for the bureaucratization of agile principles that we saw in the Atlantic piece (\"the MPL team’s experience hints that contractors, or at least their government supervisors, were less actually using agile methods than aping its lingo.\")                                        <https://18f.gsa.gov/2017/11/30/improving-government-outcomes-through-an-agile-contract-format/> ; <https://18f.gsa.gov/2017/12/14/getting-stakeholder-buy-in-for-agile-development/>",

According to AWS, “CMS turned to AWS to launch three new features for the website, including an identity management system, a feature for comparing insurance plans, and a tool to determine eligibility for specific plans based on a consumer’s income and other variables”. Intel yesterday admitted to two very serious security vulnerabilities in their processors, which affect the vast majority of computers and servers currently in use. One of these vulnerabilities, dubbed “Meltdown”, apparently poses a particular risk to cloud computing providers like AWS, potentially allowing malicious AWS users to steal information from other AWS users’ accounts. I wonder how this plays out for <http://Healthcare.gov|Healthcare.gov> data stored on AWS servers – from news coverage it sounds like a malicious actor who is smart enough to exploit Meltdown before Intel and AWS find full patches for it could potentially get access to the very personal health and income data mentioned above.",

Beyond this, a couple of themes from The Atlantic article particularly resonated with me as lessons for policy makers and technologists. \n\nFirst, policy makers need to better understand the real and tangible dangers to technology development programs posed by continuously changing policy making, which can compress the tech development cycle to the point that it becomes unsustainable. Either both technology and policy development need to be allowed to be agile, or policy development needs to be more respectful of the time required to develop functioning tech products. \n\nSecond, MPL’s experience highlights the challenges of an agile organization operating in large bureaucracy. I found MPL’s approach of leading by example and not giving up on their government counterparts remarkable. And I of course agree that CMS should have opened up to MPL’s agile work philosophy more quickly. However, I also wonder whether MPL (or The Atlantic article’s author?) could have done a better job at understanding the drivers behind government’s lack of adaptability? I found the start of the “What is Code” Bloomberg article to be an entertaining, personable tale “from the other side” – from a manager whose incentives are set up such as to naturally fear the agile process.",

I have been a volunteer VITA tax preparer for the last few years and, despite some initial hurdles, found this to be a substantial improvement.

I did some work on a military IT program that was really struggling under a waterfall model. The program was supposed to be scoped, designed, built, and rolled out in ~3 years, but after 10 years, they were still gathering requirements (you can probably imagine the magnitude of the cost overruns...). To make matters worse, the version of the platform they were using was being phased out by the vendor, and they were being forced to upgrade. All in all, it was kind of a mess. We were trying to move them over to an agile model, which would have solved a lot of their problems, but unfortunately they were bound to waterfall by legislation. In other words, they were legally obligated to design a full-fledged product and have it signed off on by several different branches of the military before they could begin building and testing. In the end we ended up radically changing the program's governance structure to enable them to fast track the requirements process and empowering them to throw away certain requirements.",

However the use of Agile by CGI F is stated as a hindrance, noting that it allowed policymakers to frequently change business requirements and technical specifications.  I wonder if this was a case of just a poor agile product manager/poor agile implementation, or more indicative of potential weaknesses of the approach as a whole?",

A couple of years ago, I was working for a non-profit organization that sought to promote open government and e-government initiatives in Mexico City. During the whole time I was there it was very difficult to overcome the cultural (and generational) divide between local public servants and programmers. The “What is Code?” article is really good at breaking down the basics, but it is still mainly focused on explaining it to managers within the private sector and not government.",

It starts by defining a motivating problem that is felt by everyone involved rather than a problem identified by a single person then tossed down with a cookbook. Then through experimental iterations teams take an action step, learn, adapt, and take another step.

    "text": "Here are the data set sources that we can explore:  Macro Level:\n\n*The Atlas of Economic Complexity includes product space and export opportunity spectrums, as well as new visualizations to explore trade data.\n\nIMF International Financial Statistics: Basic macro and national account statistics for all countries. \n\n*World Bank’s World Development Indicators: Time series of national statistics on most development outcomes.   You can also access a number of other related databases through this website (such as the Poverty and Inequality Database and the Doing Business database)\n\n* The Trading Economics website provides a number of macroeconomic indicators useful to Growth Diagnostics.\n\n*World Bank Governance Indicators cover institutional variables. \n\n* The Economist Intelligence Unit  data also provides a number of variables useful for Growth Diagnostics Analysis, in particular referring to countries’ financial sectors.  You will need your Harvard ID and PIN number to access the site without pay.\n\nOECD: stats regarding topics in economics and development, mainly for member countries.\n\nPolity IV produces nuanced time series of variables related to political structure and conflict in the country. This is a dataset used very frequently by social scientists in cross-country work on political economy.\n\nSee UNCTAD for commodity prices and trade data.\n\nThe UN also makes available a wealth of data on other topics here. \n\nThe Barro and Lee Database offers measures of educational attainment (including years of schooling by age and gender) for many countries in the world.\n\n* Google Public Data Explorer gives you easy access to multiple sources of relevant information, including easy visualization tools.  This tool includes not only the WDI database, but also the Human Development Indicators, the Global Competitiveness Report data, The World Economic Outlook data from the IMF, and many others.\n\nAnd the interactive visualizations of Gap Minder continue to be among the most popular sources to start your exploration of the data of a country.\n\nImportant Employment and Unemployment figures can be found at the ILO’s Labor STA database.\n\n*Multiple other resources can be accessed through the Alta Plana International Economics Getaway and through the HKS library website under “Research Guides” (pay specific attention to the “Economic Research” link and the “Economic Data, International” tab in that link.  Through this webpage you also get access through many scholarly articles and studies previously published (e.g. through the “Google Scholar” link).  Note that for some of these you may need to use your HUID number and PIN to get access to all the information available.\n\nIf you are comfortable with using Stata, you are able to access some of the same datasets already in Stata format and ready for analysis, at the MD4Stata website of the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva.\n\nFirm Level:\n\n*The World Bank’s Doing Business statistics can give you a general sense of the main factors affecting investors’ decisions in a country. \n\n*Even more interesting are the Bank’s Enterprise Surveys of individual firms in many countries. This would allow for within country, across firm comparisons. You just have to send an email introducing yourself and can get the data in a few days.\n\nThe results from the Investment Climate Assessments of the IFC can also be useful.\n\n\nHousehold and Firm Level:\n\nFrom these websites, use only summarized data when available and if you need them - that is, we don’t expect you to use micro-level data (the data of the answers to the surveys) to estimate summary statistics for this class.\n\nIPUMS: Standardized census and survey data from many countries.\n\nLiving Standards Measurement Surveys from the World Bank are a great set of country level household surveys with a variety of data points. These could be used as a substitute for IPUMS but will be a bit more complex, and require facility with STATA to use.",

To understand the concept, you should think of ‘free’ as in ‘free speech,’ not as in ‘free beer.’” What about the nature of software gives people a 'right' to it, in the same way we have a right to speech? Why should software be treated differently than any other intellectual property? I think the argument is that the purpose of software is to better society, therefore must be open to all. I'm not sure I agree that bettering society is software's inherent purpose so definitionally that it changes how its treated as IP.  And, the precedence doesn't really hold that anything with a purpose to better society must be free: vaccines, great curriculums, music etc. all have IP protections. (You could argue that precedent =/= moral, though).\n\nSIDE NOTE: I don't think this is the main ethical question surrounding why a congressional office should adopt open source. Free software does not have to be considered a fundamental right in order to make an ethical claim that the government should adopt it. There are loads of ethical arguments surrounding fairness, duty to citizens, protection of citizens, etc. that do not suppose an inherent 'right' to free software. But I've been really interested/hung up on the 'fundamental right' part, why FLOSS believes software should be treated as such.",

After reviewing a range of articles and blog posts, I'm not sure we can advocate for OSS on cost alone, particularly as the cost varies depending on the organisation's technology stack and maintenance standards. I recently came across another compelling point for OSS: it offers relative price certainty, as opposed to licensing through Microsoft who can hike their prices when they feel like they are in a strong market position. This feels a little counter intuitive but I've come across a number of complaints: <https://www.computerworld.com/article/3011406/enterprise-applications/microsoft-jacks-price-of-top-tier-office-365-plan-by-59.html>.  My take on the cost component is that OSS is comparable in cost to proprietary software, if not cheaper in many cases. At the same time OSS appears to deliver benefits in other areas by providing more transparency, control, flexibility, and security. It is this total package that makes it more attractive than proprietary software.",

It also links to a wide variety of government and commercial organizations that have made significant financial savings because of open source. Please see the link above for more information on each of these points if interested:\n\n1. OSS costs less to initially acquire. \n2. Upgrade/maintenance costs are typically far less. \n3. OSS does not impose license management costs, does not in practice include noxious licensing clauses, and avoids nearly all licensing litigation risks.\n4. OSS can often use older hardware more efficiently than proprietary systems, yielding smaller hardware costs and sometimes eliminating the need for new hardware.\n5. When used as an application server based system, the total costs for hardware drop by orders of magnitude.\n6. OSS tends to require less ongoing administration; a survey of European governments found that administrators of OSS systems can handle 35% more PCs per IT administrator than administrators of proprietary systems.\n7. As the number of systems and hardware performance increases, this difference in initial and upgrade costs becomes even more substantial.",

For me, it seems like the more user-specific a product, the more affordable it becomes to make it open source, because the price is already high due to the lack of other possible customers. In turn, maybe this is just a procurement issue, where buyers should request pricing for multiple licensing options (from proprietary to totally OSS). The vendor should have a better idea than the buyer about Total Addressable Market, so the different prices would likely be very informative. Your word processor probably won't become open source, but your super-specific apps might. That would probably reduce all the enthusiasm about OSS, but much of it seems a bit naive anyway.",

I've only skimmed it, but it seems at that time they were unable to conclude whether the direct financial cost of OSS was actually lower due to a lack of data in the public sector (OSS has zero licensing costs, but the different supply chain for applications and support services made direct comparison difficult). They did, however, point out a number of indirect cost savings opportunities from switching to OSS, namely reducing vendor lock-in and maintaining the ability to tweak and customize for evolving needs. In other words, better software, and lower duplication costs (e.g., local authorities facing similar software needs can adapt existing software). One cost a few of the surveyed companies noted was hiring experts to support them in taking more direct control of their infrastructure.",

For example, assuming a standard software product that has a high fixed cost and negligible variable cost, if a buyer requests open source, that means the buyer must pay the entire fixed cost.
