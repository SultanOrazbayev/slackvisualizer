I posted about this earlier, but Jupyter is a great platform to experiment with code, try visualizations, and work with data in multiple languages. You will need to install Jupyter (probably best through Conda) to see my notebook. Hopefully this will be a useful resource for you all who want to keep learning Python and need a way to remind yourself of what you learned.",

I tried uninstalling and reinstalling and double checked the version compatibility, but this did not produce any results.\n\nFor now, I'm just using option 2 (running Ubuntu within windows 10), but it might be nice to figure out what went wrong.

If you are looking for a chief of staff role in the future, the economic prospects look like they can vary by quite a wide margin. 105 amounts paid were for $935 in the quarter. I would hope that these are biweekly paychecks, but this would seem to hover right around the poverty line. On the other hand, 66 people were paid $41,167 for the quarter which would lend itself to a nice salary. Also, if you are looking for a chief of staff position, it would appear that Nancy Pelosi would be the place to start -- she had twice the payments compared to the speaker of the house, Paul Ryan!

It seems like there a few ways of gathering tweets, including identifying twitter handles of interest.\n\nIf we decide to go with one of our \"As a voter who wants to vote in 2020 for a Democrat candidate emphasizing education...\" then we could maybe collect handles for members of the (large, ill-defined) field of candidates.\n\nIt's hard for me not to lapse into \"waterfall\" ways (i.e. setting a project timeline and clear outcomes), but hopefully we'll get some traction after we lock down our intended audience",

It has tons of characteristics of US colleges (size, type, student demographics, etc.). I think it might be interesting to look at whether the frequency of different types of schools (for- or non-profit) within states seems related to other characteristics of the state (that we could pull from census data, like poverty rate, etc.). For instance, are for-profit schools (that famously are exploitative of low-income students) more common in states with higher poverty rates?",

Perhaps we could consider finding our data set on one of those sites.\n\nOr, <@UF41X1ECV> if you want our project to focus more on bureaucratic/administrative aspects of education, we could maybe look into teacher absenteeism, the prevalence of public v. low-cost private schools in under-resourced settings, etc. Thoughts?\n\nWe could also consider comparing across different types of data (e.g. public opinion data as it compares to measured educational inputs/outputs..). I'm a big fan of Afrobarometer--they have continent-wide public opinion data on questions like whether girls and boys are perceived to have equal access to education (<http://afrobarometer.org/fr/analyse-de-donn%C3%A9es-en-ligne/l%27analyse-en-ligne#.XDIQhruMKeI.gmail>) (There's also Asiabarometer, etc.)\n\nI also saw a couple of interesting visualizations that might provide some inspiration as we think about our website:\n<http://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/>\n<https://ourworldindata.org/teachers-and-professors>",

An Opportunity Zone is a designated geographic area, in which individuals can gain favorable tax treatment on their capital gains, by investing those funds (through a privately-created Opportunity Fund) into economic activities in the area. The U.S. Treasury has designated 138 tracts in 79 Massachusetts communities as Opportunity Zones. The Opportunity Zone program presents an opportunity for private, tax-advantaged investment into areas of economic need, benefiting both residents living in the zones and private investors. Governor Charlie Baker announced the designations on May 18, 2018.\n\nSome of the Massachusetts opportunity zones certified by the U.S. Department of the Treasury have left locals scratching their heads over why an incentive is needed to build. While low-income parts of Fall River, Springfield and New Bedford made the cut, so did neighborhoods in places like the tourist-heavy Provincetown as well as Alewife in West Cambridge, which developers are already building up as a life science relief valve to Kendall Square.",

This is still fairly recent so there's not a ton of data out there, but I have been able to find a dataset with all of the census tracts that were nominated and are eligible (<https://www.cdfifund.gov/Pages/Opportunity-Zones.aspx>).  I thought this could be represented as a map comparing the number / percentage in different states or could even be done at a city level (e.g., comparing the number between cities).  Am not yet super invested in this specific idea, so welcome any and all feedback!",

Rather, you will find a dataset and place it in a folder within your repository.\n\nFor each dataset you should have:\n\na copy of the original data in the format you got it in\na README.md or README.txt file with a link to the original data source and an explanation about how you transformed the original data into the final format you needed. If you’ve done the transformation using a python script, just uplaod that script (no need to document). If you used some other means, please document your data transformation process in the README file. It should be a step by step explanation, not just one pithy sentence like “I transformed the data with excel”.\na copy of the final data which will be consumed by the visualization\nRemember, sometimes you might be able to tell a better story by filtering the data down to an interesting subset rather than visualizing all of it.\n\nNot sure if we need to do this before tomorrow for our MVP (in fact I doubt that we do), but we should do this before our final submission!",

In order to make it as seamless as possible, I would like to build an API to draw this data in as it's released from government agencies.\n\nExamples of where to find the data might be:\n<https://fred.stlouisfed.org/tags/series?t=nipa>,\n<https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/Pages/index.aspx>,\n<https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp/gross-domestic-product>,\n<https://www.bls.gov/bls/unemployment.htm>\n\nAnd the visualization could look similar to the FT's monitor on their website: <https://ig.ft.com/sites/numbers/economies/us>\n\nMy *second idea* is similar, but involves visualizing equities using real-time stock data from <http://yahoo.finance.com|yahoo.finance.com> to build a dataset of equities to model stock performance in real time.\n\nLet me know what you guys think and looking forward to chatting with you all tomorrow in class!\n\nJake",

In one of our projects, we had too many people involved with no clear, quick way to keep track of the deliverables. One of the consultants introduced SCRUM to the leadership team, including only the top 7 people leading each team to provide very quick headlines on their progress and the roadblocks.\n\nUltimately, SCRUM didn't hold up to our expectations. As <@UF19DNZ5E> mentioned, it is difficult to implement SCRUM on monumental size projects. In total, we had over 150 people working on the project, and to narrow it down to just 7 people for frequent, daily meetings meant that these 7 people spent their entire days obtaining updates from their staff, however small. They did not trust leaders from other teams, hence the stand-up meetings simply became somewhat of a pissing contest. Saying nothing would have been terribly embarrassing and nobody wants to talk about their roadblocks. This was in Southeast Asia, where \"saving one's face\" is commonly important.\n\nAs mentioned by my other classmates, I wonder if SCRUM has a place in large scale projects, and in areas where cultures where trust is not the norm. I'm only halfway through the book and am still reading up more material, so I hope I will be convinced otherwise by the end of this class!",

    "text": "Really enjoyed this set of readings. Two strains of thought came to mind, both related to personal career experiences. First off, these readings have continually reinforced how my first job at IBM in IT project management was largely learning an obsolete craft. For two years, we were ingrained to employ the waterfall method and consistently valued documentation and project tracking over actually getting the software done right by creating user value. We slowly started to do some things to shift towards agile lite like deploying automated testing and breaking the massive phased projects into smaller chunks that were somewhat \"Sprint\" like. Still, a valuable experience to learn the pitfalls of a failed approach (which were demonstrated by our constant project delays and client tension. Second, the readings made me think about my own effort this summer in Chicago to promote a \"US Digital Service Model\" for Chicago's City Government. Serving as an intern in the Mayor's Office, we were each tasked with proposing a New Idea as part of annual competition. I had read about the US Digital Service Model and a similar version at the city level in Austin, TX and decided to proposed replicating it Chicago. It was interesting how the turf war nature of Chicago's city government immediately disliked the idea of IT folks coming in and messing with traditional lines of authority. By the end of the summer, I was able to make some progress in encouraging the idea, but it demonstrated the difficulty in pitching \"good ideas\" with proven results, especially when they cause disruption in the status quo.",

    "text": "I wonder how much Agile and Scrum have been explored in other sectors and what the results have been. A good example is that of R&amp;D grants. Granting agencies like NSF or DoE traditionally grant resources to R&amp;D projects based on a waterfall approach. The R&amp;D process is one of information discovery, meaning that at the onset of a project, the outcomes could be predicted but not guaranteed. On top of that, an R&amp;D project can reveal new information that is not known before the grant was awarded but that merits pursuing new and different activities. Researchers and granting agencies could benefit highly from adopting an agile framework in which grants are approved based on scientific merit of a team and the general ideas they want to pursue. Progress can be reviewed in sprints and rather than having a complete project described at the onset, the activities could flow with the newly acquired information to areas that show higher promise for breakthrough or innovation.",

    "text": "I was particularly moved by The Atlantic article about <http://Healthcare.gov|Healthcare.gov>. At the risk of sounding too idealistic/naïve (which Sam appropriately addresses above), I was pretty excited to think about this team of coders tackling such a massive and important system and ultimately being able to cut the cost of building the system by $256 million and the cost of annual maintenance by $69 million. I wish I could understand coding better just so I can get a more technical understanding of their approach. How did this team know where to even begin when they opened the login page and identified glitches?\nThe part about the team having to wait to get a security review on AWS really resonated with me as someone who worked in federal contracting before coming to HKS. Deadlines often get pushed further and further into the future for project components that in theory shouldn’t be a source of stress, which can be frustrating. This relates to a topic that I would love to have the speakers’ take on: there seems to be so many “blockers” to implementing significant change in government systems- from budgeting to deep-seated silos to outdated procurement to overall skepticism. What would the speakers say are major barriers to applying scrum in the public sector that one wouldn’t typically see in the private sector, and how do they envision overcoming them using Scrum techniques? In the second Scrum reading, one of the barriers, skepticism, was raised, but the solution was glossed over. I imagine this is a major issue in the public sector, but also an inconsistent one. I wonder if the speakers have any experience/successes with overcoming it that they could share.",

Echoing Danny’s question, I’m looking forward to hearing from our speakers about how to successfully implement agile and scrum in the context of a more hierarchical/traditional organization.\n- In “Elements of Scrum”, I loved learning about determining the relative amount of work each task will require. It seems like a way of allocating time and effort that is so intuitive, I might apply it to my own to do lists.\n- In reading the <http://healthcare.gov|healthcare.gov> articles, one mentioned the failure of opening the website to everyone at once instead of starting with a small circle to get feedback, iterate, and expand to more people over time. While starting small and iterating seems to be the way to get a good working product, in the context of a government service, how do you decide who gets first access in an equitable manner? Is it unfair to offer it to some, but not others? Alternatively, this may be irrelevant if we set up the roll out to be transparent about who will get access and when.",

    "text": "Many policymakers are painfully unaware of how data can be used to advance their policy goals in a more targeted way to better serve constituents. Even slow and cumbersome systems like at the FBI can prevent organizational missions from being completed successfully. In my personal experience, government technology systems lag behind those of private firms, and for some obvious reasons (like funding). But if improving technology improves the functionality of government, then technology enhancements should be a top priority for governments.\n\nA question to our guest speakers: what are the main barriers to productivity or effectiveness in your experience in government? What are some specific ways we can apply the agile/scrum mindset to overcome obstacles to flow in our teams? And, given that not everyone on a team will have experience working in scrum, what methods should we use to change the mindset of our teams? I don’t want to rely too much on training, but at the same time, these processes only work if everyone buys in. So, especially if we are not the team manager, how do we promote buy in and collaboration around this approach?\n\nIt also seems like there are tradeoffs between getting work done as quickly as possible and doing it right, even if it takes slightly longer. It makes sense that most teams have areas where efficiency can be improved, but in some cases the teams are working as fast as can be reasonably expected. As a manager, what tools can be used to identify the point at which efficiencies are being maximized, without crossing over into the space where errors are being made?",

    "text": "Scrum/Agile is definitely a thought provoking approach to team management.  I worry a bit that there may be a false dichotomy between a more agile approach and a waterfall method.  Here are a few of the concerns I came up with:\n-Scalability.  Its not clear to me how scrums would work on monumental size projects.  Communication between hierarchical or peer scrums is not facilitated.  This could result in teams independently \"re-inventing the wheel\" to solve the same or similar problems.  Additionally, Scrum's heavy reliance on trust would make it very hard to incorporate into big organizations.  Similarly, self organizing teams seems unlikely in some of these institutions.\n-Story choice aggregation.  The increasingly short nature of sprints makes the focus more and more on small user choices.  For instance, Facebook programmers might be looking at a user story in which the user desires some convenience at a small cost of privacy.  This story may be perfectly fine in the individual case, but as the same choice is repeated you can end up in a place you never expected.\n-Similarly, some choices and priorities are inherently more likely to \"win\" out over time.  For instance, a story about user convenience is likely relatively straightforward and easily quantifiable (some period of time saved).  A story about privacy is likely to be much more convoluted and more difficult to break into bite sized pieces.  Thus by the Scrum methodology, the convenience story is likely to continuously rise to the top of the list while privacy remains at the bottom as a bigger, more nebulous story.  This is true of other concepts such as autonomy (freedom) vs safety or security.\n-Organized labor.  I've been trying to conceptualize what a Scrum environment would look like in an industry with strong unions.  Haven't come up with anything yet.\n\nThis isn't intended to be overly negative towards the Agile process, it has many advantages.  Is there a way to combine the advantages of a Scrum-like approach with those from Waterfall planning?",

Some of this likely has to do with the rigid structure in which government departments operate, which makes me wonder: how can we change government as a whole to keep up with the changing demands of the 21st century?",

That isn’t to say that the folks who got <http://healthcare.gov|healthcare.gov> working weren’t very smart or talented, but it seems like the agile ideal would be to have them integrated more smoothly into the government’s infrastructure, able to collaborate with non-coder colleagues on a day-to-day basis. Granted, a lot of the mystique here might be media-created and not reflective of the on-the-ground experience of government employees who worked with the coders, but it still seems like scrum has a bit of an image problem. I wonder what teams using scrum methods can do to overcome programming's mystique and appear more approachable for non-coder stakeholders, since it won’t do much good for coders to want to collaborate if the non-coders are hesitant to do so.",

Other digital HKS courses, such as Product Management, Digital Government, and Future Issues in Cyber-Security Policy also mentioned about differences between waterfall and agile.

Similarly, projects that failed due to waterfall were mentioned in various ways.

Again, I am curious about government projects that require extra caution and face critical scrutiny (and where people love \"control and predictability\" and less tolerant about failures). 3) Scrum members have total authority over how the work gets done and seem to have lots of discretion. How does the team ensure continuity if  a team member left unexpectedly, given that there is no detailed documentation?",

And the joke about “a chicken and a pig” try to indicate the members in the scrum team are committed to the work rather than finish it. I have two questions about it,\n\nQ1: Think about the “assembly line” of Ford company in 1913, the way of workers just need to focus on their own part of work, it’s more like to finish it rather than commit the work. The advantage of the assembly line is efficiency. It is obvious that the scrum team is not assembly line but with the high efficiency. How does it work, is that also means the way of assembly line is out of date?\n\nQ2: Since the scrum is an open system, how to guarantee the information security between a lot of different cooperation especially in government project need to be confidential.",

I have one question about agile as it pertains to government organizations--do you think an agile approach could potentially allow for security risks by bringing in a wider array of participants? 18f would seem to open the door for a lot of people (perhaps with no security clearance) to be highly involved in producing government platforms, etc.\n\nTo be a bit more specific -- The Wired piece (on the Obama tech surge) seems to mock fears of a flexible, parachute-in approach to fixing problems. Do you think these concerns are valid at all?\n\nExcerpt:\n\"Judging from the focus of a recent hearingheld by the House Oversight and Government Reform IT Subcommittee, one might think that the most pressing issue in government tech was not saving money and delivering services effectively, but making sure that the Chief Information Officer (CIO) in a given agency has total reign over his or her domain (Congress had recently passed a law granting agency CIOs more authority). Will Hurd, the subcommittee chair, frettedd that USDS people might “parachute into an agency, and fix things, without the knowledge of the CIO.”\n“But the calls for “accountability” from this nascent effort seem out of proportion to the tiny investment that the USDS represents. In fact, these demands seem very much a part of the risk-averse culture that led us to the current mess in government IT.”",

    "text": "I'm still reflecting on the Scrum readings, but a few initial thoughts and questions:\n-One aspect I feel like most of the readings glossed over was how the \"gathering requirements\" step is much faster or more efficient using Agile methodologies or Scrums.  Wouldn't you still need to do the legwork of understanding basic requirements and creating User Stories?  How long does this take?  What makes it fundamentally faster than the same step in the Waterfall?  My understanding is that it leads to efficiencies down the line as you only prioritize what is truly needed, but in order to do that, don't you still need to build this basic foundation of requirements?\n-I'm curious about how the contract negotiation and expectation setting works using this model.  I thought the readings made great points about the added bureaucracy, difficulty in sticking to predetermined milestones, and frequent cost overruns using the Waterfall method.  But it also highlighted the skepticism that stakeholders may have towards the limited information an agile team would be able to provide at the offset of a project.  It looks like most agile teams are able to build trust with stakeholders over time through constant interaction and early delivery of working products, but how do they get over the first hurdle?  How have these teams been able to avoid the pitfalls of the Waterfall approach and structure more efficient contracts while also managing  their stakeholders' expectations?\n-Echoing some of the sentiments brought up in class, even after the readings I have a keen sense that using Scrum teams must be predicated on having a really strong and motivated team.  Based on my own experience working across a couple of different sectors, I really have a hard time visualizing this working in many non-tech environments.  I would be really curious to hear successful cases of where this has worked beyond technology development\n-As a bit of an aside, I was a bit surprised by the harsh treatment \"Scrum: The Art of Doing Work in Half the Time\" gave to Gantt Charts.  While it's likely not the best way to plan projects, I've seen them used very successfully in general project planning (though I may be biased given my background--in my former life as a consultant and when working with non-profits, setting clear project plans, deadlines, and expectations were essential).  This relates to my previous point in that I'm still a bit skeptical of how well this approach works in other contexts",

We are using scrum for both groups, but one group is smaller than recommended and one is larger - in our small group, we haven’t designated a project owner, scrum master, etc. which seems appropriate for the timeframe, but have other groups tried to put in additional structures? In the overall class, we will still have standup with all 16 people, but would it make more sense to designate one person per group to talk about how the class is working for that group’s learning goals? Is there a way that scrum structures can cascade upwards easily?\n\nAlternatively, or in addition, should there be a way in which scrum groups dialogue about what is working or share their learnings with the greater team.

I thought it would be interesting to visualize Brazil’s climate goals (from their INDC) and show how Bolsonaro’s policies compare. We could break this down by sector and potentially showing how this could affect Amazon forest cover by using Google Earth Engine (which uses Javascript to work with satellite imagery).\n\nSince talking to the team, it seems like it may be better to do something more centered on climate change impacts on the city. We could take a few different case studies (based on what data is available) and try to visualize current and future impacts of climate change. If possible, I would like to try my hand at Google Earth Engine through this project (one of my learning goals), but I think this software could have various applications to a potential project including showing drought, forest cover, and other landscape-level changes.\n\n*Here is what I wrote out about the first idea that I think we will not use*:\n* Show how Bolsonaro’s policies could impact the Amazon rainforest\n* How that could relate to climate change\n* How that could relate to Brazil’s NDC and climate goals (I wrote a memo on Brazil’s NDC and climate goals before Bolsonaro was elected)\n\nThings we need:\n* Understanding of previous policy (have this)\n* Understanding of his policy (don’t have this)\n* Find datasets (don’t have this)\n* Start visualizing different sectors and change (don’t have this)",
