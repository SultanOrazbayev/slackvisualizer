Intel yesterday admitted to two very serious security vulnerabilities in their processors, which affect the vast majority of computers and servers currently in use.

Beyond this, a couple of themes from The Atlantic article particularly resonated with me as lessons for policy makers and technologists. \n\nFirst, policy makers need to better understand the real and tangible dangers to technology development programs posed by continuously changing policy making, which can compress the tech development cycle to the point that it becomes unsustainable. Either both technology and policy development need to be allowed to be agile, or policy development needs to be more respectful of the time required to develop functioning tech products. \n\nSecond, MPL\u2019s experience highlights the challenges of an agile organization operating in large bureaucracy. I found MPL\u2019s approach of leading by example and not giving up on their government counterparts remarkable. And I of course agree that CMS should have opened up to MPL\u2019s agile work philosophy more quickly. However, I also wonder whether MPL (or The Atlantic article\u2019s author?) could have done a better job at understanding the drivers behind government\u2019s lack of adaptability?

To make matters worse, the version of the platform they were using was being phased out by the vendor, and they were being forced to upgrade. All in all, it was kind of a mess. We were trying to move them over to an agile model, which would have solved a lot of their problems, but unfortunately they were bound to waterfall by legislation. In other words, they were legally obligated to design a full-fledged product and have it signed off on by several different branches of the military before they could begin building and testing.

You can also access a number of other related databases through this website (such as the Poverty and Inequality Database and the Doing Business database)\n\n* The Trading Economics website provides a number of macroeconomic indicators useful to Growth Diagnostics.\n\n*World Bank Governance Indicators cover institutional variables. \n\n* The Economist Intelligence Unit  data also provides a number of variables useful for Growth Diagnostics Analysis, in particular referring to countries\u2019 financial sectors.  You will need your Harvard ID and PIN number to access the site without pay.\n\nOECD: stats regarding topics in economics and development, mainly for member countries.\n\nPolity IV produces nuanced time series of variables related to political structure and conflict in the country. This is a dataset used very frequently by social scientists in cross-country work on political economy.\n\nSee UNCTAD for commodity prices and trade data.\n\nThe UN also makes available a wealth of data on other topics here. \n\nThe Barro and Lee Database offers measures of educational attainment (including years of schooling by age and gender) for many countries in the world.\n\n* Google Public Data Explorer gives you easy access to multiple sources of relevant information, including easy visualization tools.  This tool includes not only the WDI database, but also the Human Development Indicators, the Global Competitiveness Report data, The World Economic Outlook data from the IMF, and many others.\n\nAnd the interactive visualizations of Gap Minder continue to be among the most popular sources to start your exploration of the data of a country.\n\nImportant Employment and Unemployment figures can be found at the ILO\u2019s Labor STA database.\n\n*Multiple other resources can be accessed through the Alta Plana International Economics Getaway and through the HKS library website under \u201cResearch Guides\u201d (pay specific attention to the \u201cEconomic Research\u201d link and the \u201cEconomic Data, International\u201d tab in that link.  Through this webpage you also get access through many scholarly articles and studies previously published (e.g. through the \u201cGoogle Scholar\u201d link).  Note that for some of these you may need to use your HUID number and PIN to get access to all the information available.\n\nIf you are comfortable with using Stata, you are able to access some of the same datasets already in Stata format and ready for analysis, at the MD4Stata website of the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva.\n\nFirm Level:\n\n*The World Bank\u2019s Doing Business statistics can give you a general sense of the main factors affecting investors\u2019 decisions in a country. \n\n*Even more interesting are the Bank\u2019s Enterprise Surveys of individual firms in many countries. This would allow for within country, across firm comparisons. You just have to send an email introducing yourself and can get the data in a few days.\n\nThe results from the Investment Climate Assessments of the IFC can also be useful.\n\n\nHousehold and Firm Level:\n\nFrom these websites, use only summarized data when available and if you need them - that is, we don\u2019t expect you to use micro-level data (the data of the answers to the surveys) to estimate summary statistics for this class.\n\nIPUMS: Standardized census and survey data from many countries.\n\nLiving Standards Measurement Surveys from the World Bank are a great set of country level household surveys with a variety of data points.
